## What is it? <a name="what"></a>
This is a fun little application meant to help you save books you want to read, powered by the Google book search Api and more!


## Why did I make this? <a name="why"></a>
I need a way to showcase my skills in using React with apolloserver and client. I felt this was an excellent challenge (still is) to try and figure out the puzzle. 


## How did I go about building this? <a name="how"></a>
Starting with needing a vareity of node packages, React being the main frontend use, mongoDB for the database, and then express and graphql to handle requests.
